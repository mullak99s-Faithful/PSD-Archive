# mullak99's Faithful 32x - PSD's

Some of the raw PSD's used in the creation of mullak99's Faithful (and FaithfulVenom). This isn't all of them, rather these are the ones that I remembered to save.  

It's also possible that some of these are outdated, this would be the case if they were replaced with CF / CF ProgArt textures.

## Credits

Many of these textures contain some (or many) elements from Classic Faithful, Classic Faithful Programmer Art, and Vattic's textures.  
A breakdown of this can be found in the [Credits of the main repo](https://github.com/mullak99s-Faithful/mullak99sFaithful/blob/master/Credits.txt).

[Vattic](https://web.archive.org/web/20150607220656/http://www.minecraftforum.net:80/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223254-faithful-32x32-pack-update-red-cat-clay-1-8) for creating the original Faithful 32x.  
[Classic Faithful](https://github.com/ClassicFaithful) for creating the Classic Faithful packs.  
[Faithful Team](https://faithfulpack.net/) for creating the Faithful pack.  
The community in the "Faithful" Discord, as well as the "Classic Faithful" Discord for maintaining Vattic's original Faithful.  

Honestly, I cannot reasonably list the amount of noteworthy mentions and other credits.  

A majority of this pack would not exist if not for Vattic, the [Faithful Team](https://faithfulpack.net/), and the [Classic Faithful Team](https://github.com/ClassicFaithful).
